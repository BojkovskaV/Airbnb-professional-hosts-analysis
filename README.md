**Author:** Verica Bojkovska  
**Date:** July 2025

## 📌 Objective
Analyze Airbnb listings from six cities to identify trends among inferred professional hosts — those who manage multiple listings — using data from InsideAirbnb.

## 🗃️ Data Source
- Data compiled by [InsideAirbnb](http://insideairbnb.com) between October–November 2021.
- Cities included: Austin, Bangkok, Buenos Aires, Cape Town, Istanbul, Melbourne.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, folium)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control

## ✏️ Key Steps
1. Load and combine datasets for six cities.
2. Flag professional hosts as those with >1 listing.
3. Calculate % of listings run by professionals.
4. Compare prices, minimum nights, and availability.
5. Visualize distribution by city, room type, and neighborhood.
6. Create interactive maps of listings by host type.

## ✨ Findings
- Estimated ~55% of listings are operated by professional hosts.
- Bangkok has the highest share (~70%), Austin the lowest (~46%).
- Professional hosts tend to charge slightly more per night and have higher availability.
- Visualized trends highlight patterns for different room types and neighborhoods.
